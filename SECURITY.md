# Security Policy

The Royal Navy Standards Policy is to avoid leaving the ecosystem worse than we found it. Meaning we are not planning to introduce vulnerabilities into the ecosystem.

The Royal Navy Design System team takes security vulnerabilities in the Royal Navy Design System seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email design-system@navy.digital.mod.uk include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

Please include:

- Your name and affiliation (if any)
- A brief description of the vulnerability
- The website page or repository component where the vulnerability exists
- Steps to identify the vulnerability. It is important that we can reproduce your findings.

## Qualifying Vulnerabilities

Any reproducible vulnerability that has a severe effect on the security or privacy of our users is likely to be in scope for the program. Common examples include Cross-site scripting (XSS), Server-side code injection (SSI), Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), Server-side request forgery (SSRF), Remote code execution (RCE), Sensitive data exposure and privilege escalation.

The following are not in scope:
volumetric vulnerabilities, for example overwhelming a service with a high volume of requests

## Usage Recommendations

We recommend following the OWASP [**guidance**](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Nodejs_security_cheat_sheet.html) for developing secure Node.js applications

## Known Security Gaps & Future Enhancements

We will publish here any known security improvements we have not got to yet. We welcome contributions.
