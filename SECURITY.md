# Security Policy
The Royal Navy Digital Standards Policy is to avoid leaving the ecosystem worse than we found it. Meaning we are not planning to introduce vulnerabilities into the ecosystem.

The Royal Navy Digital Standards team takes security vulnerabilities in the Standards Toolkit seriously.  We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.
