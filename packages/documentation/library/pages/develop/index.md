# Experimental Code Ahead

Both the [CSS Framework](/bedrock) and Component Library are in their early stages of development. Feedback we gather at this hackathon will greatly help shape and steer the direction of both these projects.

# Welcome to the component library

This is a Component Library, provided to serve as a base for all NELSON applcations. It sits on top of [The CSS framework](/css-framework) and acts as a UI Kit, ensuring all NELSON Apps are consistent in look and behaviour.

It is currently built with [VueJS](http://vuejs.org), however in the future we will be expanding this to additional front end frameworks (e.g. React).

## What We Provide

In its current form, only basic components are provided.

- expanding to more detailed components once more applications are created
- Invite hackathon atendees to suggest components/additions
