The Nelson toolkit provides a suite of components and CSS styles which you can use to build your webapp. 

## Assumptions

This guide makes the following assumptions:

- You have basic knowledge of HTML
- You have basic knowledge of CSS
- You are comfortable working with SASS

## Components

The toolkit includes components to help build up a page with minimal coding, this guide contains HTML snippets which you can copy and paste directly into your HTML page and use immediately.

[A full list of those components is available here](/develop/).

## Installation

In order to use the HTML snippets you will first need to add the toolkit CSS to your HTML file.

To do this locate the `<head>` section and add the following snippet:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

View the page in a browser and you should be good to go.

## Layouts

The NELSON Toolkit contains support for both horizontal and vertical app layouts. Visit the [Layout Component docs](/develop/components/layout) for more information.

## Use with front-end frameworks.

These components and classes can be used in any package, however if you are using a front-end framework like React or Vue, the component HTML may need to be altered to accommodate this. 

Whilst the current version of the NELSON toolkit (`v0.1.0`) doesn't contain any React or Vue components, from `v.0.2.0` we will begin adding support for these frameworks. Keep an eye on this website for more information.
