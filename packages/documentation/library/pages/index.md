# Welcome to the Nelson Toolkit

This project is the end-to-end toolkit serving as the foundation for Royal Navy applications - we provide tools and resources to aid with the rapid design & development of apps and services.

The NELSON Toolkit is under constant development - our aim is to grow the project into a rich ecosystem of patterns, components, and starter apps. If you would like to contribute in any way, our entire toolkit is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/royal-navy/standards-toolkit).
