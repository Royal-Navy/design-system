# Form alignment and spacing
Humans instinctively tend to look for patterns, structure and order. When we meet a friend, we don’t recognise their
hair, eyes and nose - we recognise their face.

In a similar way, the components of a form as a whole are perceived differently than the same components on their own.
A user’s perception of the ‘whole’ determines how they will interact with the form.
Appropriate alignment and spacing helps them navigate through your form and make sense of its structure and groupings.

Our alignment and spacing Standards are based on the Gestalt principles, with the intention of helping users
quickly identify groupings and the most efficient way of filling in a form.

## 7. Alignment

###### 7.0 All form columns, section dividers, fields and labels *must* be left aligned.
> This is because (in Western cultures) it is easier for users to scan a form vertically and navigate through it with a mouse when everything is left aligned.

###### 7.1 Input field widths *must* reflect the expected input length.
> For example, when asking for an address, the input field width for the first line of the address should be wider than the postcode input  field, reflecting the difference in the expected input length.

###### 7.2 You must not use more than four different widths for form components.
> While input field widths must reflect the expected input length, too many distinct widths result in visual ‘noise’ and have the opposite effect than intended. To maintain visual balance use components that correspond to 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% of your form width, with the necessary spacing between them as described in the next section.

## 8. Spacing
###### 8.0 You *must* ensure all form components are spaced using the margins specified.
###### 8.1 The margin between your form and its container or nearest neighbour *must not* be smaller than 20 pixels.
> Where possible, you should aim for a margin of at least 32 pixels. Different contexts may require different margins. In exceptional cases (eg. a small number of fields within a complex interface), you may use a small margin, but no smaller than 20 pixels. Forms may appear as dedicated pages or within a Dialog, a Drawer or a Modal.

### A note on borders and margins

This note applies to the active states of all components.

The height for ‘single-line’ inputs in their default state is 46px, including the border.

When a component gets focus (active state), a blue outline is added, resulting in a total height of 58px.

However, form inputs should not ‘jump around’ as the focus moves between them. In practice this means that the position of a form component in relation to its neighbours does not change, regardless of the state it is in (default or selected).

This also applies to horizontal margins.
