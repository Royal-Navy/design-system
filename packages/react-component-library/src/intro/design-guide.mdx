# Design Principles

Here’s a checklist of everything you need to get started:

## Design tokens
The Royal Navy Design System provides tokens for colour, typography, spacing and much more. Tokens make it easy to ensure consistency across defence applications.

### The case for using tokens
The number one reason is consistency<sup>[1](#references)</sup>: the palette of `danger` is the same everywhere. End-users of Royal Navy applications highly benefit from consistency across interfaces, where the colour of danger may save lives.

Another excellent reason to always use tokens, is that if we adjust the colours of `success`, these changes are automatically made wherever it’s in use, in every single live application. Magic.

#### [Colour Tokens](?path=/docs/tokens-colours--docs)
We use named colours (e.g. Neutral or Action) instead of colour literals (e.g. blue). Colour palettes represent functions, so that we can make interactions and contexts easy to distinguish.


#### [Spacing](?path=/docs/tokens-spacing--docs)
Spacing is a key (and often overlooked) aspect of ensuring your application is easy to read and understand. Too little whitespace will cause components to become visually cramped, therefore decreasing readability. The general rule is to start with whitespace that is too large for an element and then decrease it until it is at an appropriate size. It is far better to have too much whitespace than too little.

#### [Typography](?path=/docs/tokens-typography--docs)
All Royal Navy Design System applications are set in Lato
