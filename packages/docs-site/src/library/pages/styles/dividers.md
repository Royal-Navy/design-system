# Dividers

Dividers are single pixel lines that help separate and group content together. They are available in both horizontal and vertical orientation. To use them, the `<hr>` HTML tag should be added. By default, the horizontal divider will be applied. To create a vertical divider, add a `.vertical` class to the `<hr>` tag.

**Note:** The Divider does not have any margins added because the size of the margin should be dictated by the content the `<hr>` is separating. To add appropriate margins to the `<hr>`, use the [Spacing Utility Classes](/styles/spacing/).
