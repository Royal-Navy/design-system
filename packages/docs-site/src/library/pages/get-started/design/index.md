This guide will lead you through our Sketch toolkit and the components we support.

## Sketch
The Standards Toolkit components are available in our Sketch file. This file contains all of our components as well as layout ideas examples of applications. Download the <a href="/standards-toolkit.sketch" download>Sketch Toolkit</a>

For rapid prototyping and wireframing, we recommend using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).


## Components

The Standards toolkit contains a variety of components to help you construct your applications. By ensuring all apps are built on these components, we guarantee a consistent experience across the platform. To see the list of components and the details on how to use them, visit the [Components Page](/components).
