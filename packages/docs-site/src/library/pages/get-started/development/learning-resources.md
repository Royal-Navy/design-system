We have curated a collection of learning resources to help you to get up to speed with a variety of web technologies that are foundational to the Standards Toolkit. 

These resources will help you gain the fundemental knowledge needed to successfully consume the Nelson Standards component library and SASS framework and to develop modern web applications.

### Key technologies

#### ES2015+ (modern JavaScript)
ES2015 is a significant update to the language, and the first major update to the language since ES5 was standardized in 2009.

We reccomended reading the [Babel Learn ES2015+ documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn/).

#### React
[React](https://reactjs.org/) makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

#### SASS & CSS
[Sass](https://sass-lang.com) is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

#### Build tools (webpack)
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.
