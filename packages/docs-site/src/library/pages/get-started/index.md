# Get started
NELSON Standards are made for designers and developers. There are Get Started guides for each discipline.

* As a [designer](/get-started/design), use Standards to ideate and iterate your design. The Sketch toolkit provides components and patterns to ensure Royal Navy users have a consistent experience across NELSON applications and services.
* As a [developer](/get-started/develop), use Standards libraries to save time and develop applications that are consistent for users. The guide explains installation, usage, recommended technologies and code examples.
