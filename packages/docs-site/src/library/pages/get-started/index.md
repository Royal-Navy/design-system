There are **Get Started** guides for each discipline:

* As a [designer](/get-started/design), use **Standards** to conceive and iterate your design. The Sketch toolkit provides components and patterns to ensure Royal Navy users have a consistent experience across NELSON applications and services.
* As a [developer](/get-started/development), use **Standards** libraries to save time and develop applications that are consistent for users. The guide explains installation, usage, recommended technologies and code examples.
