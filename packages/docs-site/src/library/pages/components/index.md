# Overview

Components are reusable User Interface (UI) elements like buttons, text inputs or headers. They are a modular foundation for designing, developing applications and services. Their design is based on defined NELSON [styles](/styles).

Components can be used in many design patterns and contexts. For example, a button could be used to submit information or progress to a subsequent screen.

You can read the '[get started](/get-started)' guidance to find out more about how to use components to design and develop applications.

The list of components available in NELSON is growing. If you think there is something missing or have a question please [contact the Standards team](/contact).
