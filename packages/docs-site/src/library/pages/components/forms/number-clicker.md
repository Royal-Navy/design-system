  The Number Clicker should stand out and be easily discoverable by users. The text label should be concise, effectively communicating to the user the range or value required.

  ### Anatomy
  <NumberClickerAnatomy /> 

  1. **Label**. The Label should be used to describe to the user what the desired input should be. Every field should have a text label. The label should always be visible on all inputs, excluding search bars.
  2. **User Input**. The main area the user enters a value.
  3. **Directional Buttons**. The Directional buttons step between predetermined values.
  4. **Container**. The Container wraps the entire component.

  
### Sizing & Spacing
The Number Clicker is only available in 1 size. It has been created in relation to other inputs, so will line up correctly in forms.

### States
<NumberClickerStates />

The Number Clicker has two states - Default and Focused.


The Directional Buttons also have state. Clicking on the up arrow will increase the entered value, and clicking the down arrow will decrease the value.
